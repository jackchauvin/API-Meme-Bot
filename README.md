# API-Meme-Bot
This bot takes posts from Reddit and posts them to Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.

This was a personal project to experiment with APIs.  3rd party APIs were used for Reddit, Twitter, and Instagram, and Facebook's SDK was used for Facebook.

The file manipulation is structured for a Heroku server.  This will not run properly on Windows without some edits to file paths, backslashes, etc.
