# API-Meme-Bot
This bot takes post from Reddit and Posts them to Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter

This was done as a project to experiment with APIs.  3rd party APIs were used for Reddit, Twitter, and Instagram and Facebook's SDK was used for Facebook.

The file manipulation is structured for a Heroku Server.  This will not run properly on Windows without some edits to file paths, backslashes, etc.
